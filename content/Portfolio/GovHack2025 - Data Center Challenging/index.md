## Key Highlights

🇦🇺 As Australia positions itself to become a global AI superpower, the critical question emerges: where do we build the massive data centers that will power this digital revolution? For GovHack 2025, my latest analysis provides a data-driven framework to pinpoint the most strategic locations for Australia's next wave of data infrastructure.

## 📍 A Data-Driven Framework for Siting Australia's Future Data Centers 📍

My analysis identifies and scores Australia’s major regions against five non-negotiable factors for data center success: Power, Cooling, Connectivity, Talent, and Land. <br>
Location with great potential? **Brisbane** and **ACT** emerge as the undisputed champions for immediate development, scoring a perfect and near-perfect 5 and 4.5 out of 5, respectively. Sydney and Melbourne, while slightly behind on power readiness, are hot on their heels with scores of 4, signaling massive future potential.

* **Power Availability & Reliability:**
Data centers are energy hogs, consuming millions of kWh monthly. My framework, powered by AEMO grid data, reveals Brisbane, ACT, and Adelaide as current clean energy leaders, while Melbourne and Armidale show strong future potential. Without reliable, low-carbon power, even the best location fails.

* **Cooling & Thermal Management:**
AI generates scorching waste heat. My analysis cross-references BoM temperature data with water storage maps to identify ACT, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane as the “Goldilocks zones”—regions with moderate summer heat and abundant water for efficient liquid cooling.

* **Connectivity:**
Positioned between East Asia and the US, Australia’s destiny is to be a global data hub. My mapping of submarine cables and fiber networks shows Sydney, Brisbane, and Perth as current connectivity kings, while the ACT and Melbourne are primed to leapfrog with strategic investment.

* **Talent & Labor Force:**
A data center is only as good as its engineers. Leveraging Tech Council data, my analysis confirms Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, and the ACT as the nation’s tech talent powerhouses, boasting not just large current workforces but explosive growth rates (up to 98% in Queensland) to sustain long-term operations.

* **Land & Infrastructure:**
Forget dense CBDs and remote outback. My framework uses population density as a proxy to find the perfect suburban balance: large, affordable land parcels with mature utilities. The Sydney→ACT→Melbourne corridor and outer Brisbane are the clear winners.

### 🤖 AI as My Strategic Co-Pilot 🤖

This entire framework was accelerated by AI, which helped synthesize complex geospatial, meteorological, and labor market datasets into a clear, actionable scoring system. But the real magic? Applying human domain expertise to weight the factors and interpret the nuances—because the best decisions come from human-AI partnership, not AI alone. In my next piece, I’ll break down exactly how I engineered this collaboration for maximum strategic impact.

🔗 Let’s connect and explore how data-driven site selection can turn Australia into the world’s next AI superpower!
