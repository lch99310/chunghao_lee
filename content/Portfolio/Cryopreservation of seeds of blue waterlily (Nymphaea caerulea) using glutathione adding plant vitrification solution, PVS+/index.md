This study successfully developed a method for the long-term cryopreservation of recalcitrant Blue Waterlily (*Nymphaea caerulea*) seeds by creating an enhanced cryoprotectant solution.

**Summary:**

The research first confirmed that *Nymphaea caerulea* seeds are **recalcitrant**, meaning they cannot tolerate desiccation (drying) or freezing temperatures. Traditional seed banking methods (drying and storing at -20°C) were ineffective, with seeds losing viability within 6 months, and direct exposure to -20°C or liquid nitrogen (LN) killing them outright.

The standard cryoprotectant, Plant Vitrification Solution 3 (PVS3), was also insufficient, yielding a maximum survival rate of only **23%** after cryopreservation in LN. The study identified **oxidative stress** from the accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), particularly hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), as the primary cause of this failure. The cryopreservation process itself induced a massive surge in H₂O₂ levels within the seeds.

To address this, the researchers developed a modified solution called **PVS+** by adding the antioxidant **glutathione (GSH)** to PVS3. The optimal concentration was found to be **0.08 mM GSH**. PVS+ dramatically reduced ROS accumulation during cryopreservation, keeping H₂O₂ levels near normal. This intervention rescued seed viability, increasing the survival rate after cryopreservation in LN to an impressive **97%**.

**Key Highlights:**

1.  **Recalcitrant Seeds:** *Nymphaea caerulea* seeds were definitively classified as recalcitrant, being highly sensitive to drying and cold, making traditional storage methods unsuitable for long-term conservation.
2.  **PVS3 Inefficacy:** The commonly used cryoprotectant PVS3 failed to adequately protect the seeds, achieving only a 23% survival rate after cryopreservation.
3.  **ROS as the Culprit:** The primary reason for PVS3's failure was identified as oxidative stress caused by a significant buildup of ROS (specifically H₂O₂) during the cryopreservation process.
4.  **PVS+ Solution:** A novel vitrification solution, PVS+, was created by adding 0.08 mM glutathione (GSH), a potent antioxidant, to PVS3.
5.  **High Success Rate:** PVS+ effectively mitigated oxidative stress by scavenging ROS, resulting in a dramatically improved survival rate of **97%** for cryopreserved seeds.
6.  **New Strategy:** The study demonstrates that suppressing ROS-induced oxidative stress using antioxidants like glutathione is a highly effective and promising strategy for improving the cryopreservation of recalcitrant seeds.
