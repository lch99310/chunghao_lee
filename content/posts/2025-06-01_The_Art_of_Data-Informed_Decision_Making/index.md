As a PM, I’ve navigated countless crossroads where data seemed to hold all the answers. But here’s the reality I’ve learned:
📊 Data points are signposts, not destinations.
While metrics powerfully guide product direction and feature prioritization, over-reliance on raw data can lead to costly missteps. True business impact emerges when quantitative insights fuse with domain expertise and contextual wisdom.

## A case study from my previous project
When Data Tells Half the Story: How Expert Judgment Transformed Our Predictive Model 
In a project analyzing laptop logs to predict hardware failures, my team identified a key power-related log pattern strongly correlated with malfunctions. Initial models flagged this as a critical failure signal—until false positives skyrocketed.

## 🔍 The breakthrough came through collaboration:
Domain experts revealed this log triggered not just during failures, but also in normal low-battery states while users didn’t plug in chargers.
The causality flip:
- → Faulty devices led users to abandon charging (expecting imminent failure).
- → This behavior massively amplified log generation during low-battery states.
- → Raw data misinterpreted correlation as causation. <br>
Blind data reliance missed this nuance; human experience reframed the logic.
Result: Revised models reduced false positives by contextualizing data with behavioral reality.

## The AI Era’s Unspoken Truth:
As AI democratizes analytics, polished dashboards and automated reports are table stakes. What separates strategic leaders?
- ✅ Business acumen to ask why behind the numbers
- ✅ Domain fluency to separate signals from noise
- ✅ Judgment to balance data with real-world complexity

## ✨ Key Takeaway:
Data illuminate paths, but experience navigates them. The future belongs to professionals who wield analytics not just as technicians, but as translators of insights into actionable strategy.
