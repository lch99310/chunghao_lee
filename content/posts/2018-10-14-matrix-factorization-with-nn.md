Approaching the problem of matrix factorization from a neural network point of view is quite interesting. The idea is that, when ignoring bias and activation functions, a fully-connected nework is just a series of successive linear transformations that can be expressed as successive matrix multiplications. So finding two matrices \\(\mathbf{M}_1\\) and \\(\mathbf{M}_2\\) such that \\(\mathbf{M}_1 \mathbf{M}_2 = \mathbf{M} \\) is analogous to training a *one-hidden-layer* newtork to produce a net transformation \\(\mathbf{M}\\). When succeeded, the two weight matrices \\(\mathbf{W}_1\\) and \\(\mathbf{W}_2\\) is our (non unique) answer.
 
Exploring this as an exercise actually led me to another interesting question: 
>
What is the difference between
(1) a matrix that is randomly generated, and 
(2) a matrix that is the product of two matrices that are randomly generated?

Well, the latter is probably less random ... but in what way? 

It turns out that they can behave differently in the matrix factorization problem because the former has no hidden structure but the latter does. A larger capacity model is needed to fit the former data than the latter.
