We often treat PM (Product/Program Management) and Operations as separate silos. But here’s the quiet truth: **Value isn't created in a silo.**

The ultimate metric? A user’s willingness to pay with cash or time. To truly validate that value, you must stop designing from the sidelines—**you have to be the operator.**

## 💡 The Dual Identity: The "Berkshire Hathaway Advantage"

This is the core of the "Berkshire Hathaway Advantage." I strongly resonate with Warren Buffett’s perspective:

> *“I am a better investor because I am a businessman, and a better businessman because I am an investor.”*

This implies a powerful truth for product leaders: **Dual Identity = Dual Advantage.**

## 🔄 The Virtuous Cycle: Hybrid Thinking Wins

The best PMs embrace this duality. When you step out of the "designer" role and into the "operator" role, you create a necessary feedback loop:

* 🛠️ **Design informs Ops:** Knowing how the tool was built helps you maximize efficiency and output.
* 💡 **Ops informs Design:** Feeling the pain points firsthand forces you to build **value**, not just features.

You stop building in a vacuum.

## 🎯 The Strategic Takeaway: Don’t Just Architect, Inhabit

The most valuable leaders leverage operational friction to refine their strategy. The future belongs to the inhabitants, not the architects.

In short: **Don't just build the machine—operate it to find the real insights.**
