I started to learn Golang on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) since 2025, and noticed that their blog was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Later when I decided to update my personal profile (last update around 2018...), I decided to did some research on Hugo and eventually! 

This site was originally built with Jekyll and I like the design of so-simple-theme. But 
ut Hugo was backed by Golang

Migration to Hugo [Hugo](https://jekyllrb.com/) from Jekeyll. 

Decided to use the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme after some search.
