Hi, I am Chung-Hao Lee 李崇豪

I am a Product Operation Manager managing AI/ML products at TikTok. Prior to TikTok, I have 4+ years experiences at Wistron as AI PM and at Pegatron as Factory PM.

I received MBA and Master’s in Information Systems dual degrees from University of Maryland, College Park, advised by Dr. Adam Lee and Prof. Suresh Acharya, and Bachelor’s degree from National Tsing Hua University.

I bring comprehensive expertise in technology product development, integrating data-driven decision-making to optimize Product Development, Supply Chain Management, and Manufacturing. As to my hobbies, I am interested in Baseball Analytics, History, Geopolitics and Synthetic Biology. In my free time, I am an avid LA Dodgers’ fan and I am a photographer who loves to record beauty of daily life.
