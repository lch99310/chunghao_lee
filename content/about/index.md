**" Product = Analysis + Process "**

Hi, I am Chung-Hao Lee 李崇豪

I am a Product Operation Manager managing AI/ML products at TikTok. Prior to TikTok, I have 5+ years experiences at Wistron as AI PM and at Pegatron as Factory PM.

I received MBA and Master’s in Information Systems dual degrees from University of Maryland, College Park and Bachelor’s degree from Tsing Hua University.

I bring comprehensive expertise in technology product development, integrating data-driven decision-making to optimize Product Development, Supply Chain Management, and Manufacturing. 

I like being an analyst who enjoys exploring diverse areas such as product design, business models, baseball data, and geopolitics.
I’m passionate about discovering the essence of these subjects and understanding the underlying 'why', 'what', and 'how'.

In my spare time, I am an avid LA Dodgers’ fan and I am a photographer who loves to record beauty of daily life.
