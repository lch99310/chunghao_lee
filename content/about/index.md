I received my Ph.D degree in astrophysics from National Taiwan University (NTU) at 2018. Prior to that I completed a master degree in astrophysics and majored in Physics as undergraduate, also in NTU. At the end of my Ph.D study, I decided to explore the path of machine learning and data science. I went on to work in Wistron corporation as a software engineer and contributed to a variety of machine learning related projects.  also grew during this period. Near the end of 2024, I decided to build up more skills. by going through leetcode.
