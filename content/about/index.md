Hi, I am Chung-Hao Lee 李崇豪

I am a Product Operation Manager managing AI/ML products at TikTok. Prior to TikTok, I have 5+ years experiences at Wistron as AI PM and at Pegatron as Factory PM.

I received MBA and Master’s in Information Systems dual degrees from University of Maryland, College Park and Bachelor’s degree from Tsing Hua University.

I bring comprehensive expertise in technology product development, integrating data-driven decision-making to optimize Product Development, Supply Chain Management, and Manufacturing. 
As to my hobbies, I am interested in Baseball Analytics, History, Geopolitics and Synthetic Biology. In my free time, I am an avid LA Dodgers’ fan and I am a photographer who loves to record beauty of daily life.
