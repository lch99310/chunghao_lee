I am Liang-Yao Wang 王亮堯

I received my Ph.D degree in astrophysics from National Taiwan University (NTU) at 2018. Prior to that I completed a master degree in astrophysics and majored in Physics as undergraduate, also in NTU. 

Near the end of my Ph.D study, I decided to explore the path of machine learning and data science. I went on to work in Wistron corporation as a software engineer and contributed to a variety of machine learning related projects between 2018 and 2024. My interests in software development in general has also grown during this period. 

In 2025, I am building up new skills using resources like leetcode, Boot.dev etc.
