I have been thinking about setting up a homepage/blog, but never decide how to do this. I have some requirements in mind but couldn't find a simple ideal solution. One of the difficult ones is LaTex support. A more abstract one is that I would like to keep the original note simple, better in pure text. 

After using MarkDown language to take notes for some time (I use [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/)), I realized it would be nice if one can organize the notes in better way, possibly a searchable web site or something. This is where I came across [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) about a year ago. But I am not familiar with all the web stuff and Jekyll appears too complicated for me.

Recently, I decided to look into the possibility of organizing markdown notes again and did some web search, finding what I want is probably a static site generator. Beside Jekyll, [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) also seems promising, and I can't decide which would suite my purpose better without giving one of them a try. Since GitHub pages uses Jekyll, this seems to be a good starting point.   

The final kick is finding this [so-simple-theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/so-simple-theme) template to start my site with. It looks really nice, of course, and with the "Minimal embellishments" feature it claims I am hoping to tweak and customize it with less difficulty. It turns out the whole thing is still quite complicated (given my little knowledge of basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Fortunately, google is always your friend. 

So, this is the first post and there is definitely much to explore about Jekyll. But at least the site does work (and \\(\LaTeX\\) works, too), so I am happy enough today : )
